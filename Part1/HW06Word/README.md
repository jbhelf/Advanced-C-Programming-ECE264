# Read Line from File and Count Word

Learning Goals 
==============

counts how many times a word occurs, and report the result.

* Detect whether one string is inside another string

Read Line from File and Count Words
===================================

This assignment uses `fgets` to read strings from a file, uses
`strstr` to find whehther a word is inside the string from the file.
This assignment is a simplified version of the `grep` command in
Linux.
