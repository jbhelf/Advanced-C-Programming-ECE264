# Print the path from a node to the root

Learning Goals
==============

* Construct binary trees from in-order and post-order expressions
* Find the path from a node (not necessarily a leaf node) to the root

Path to Root
============

Consider [a
binary](https://i1.wp.com/www.techiedelight.com/wp-content/uploads/Root-To-Leaf-Paths.png?resize=323%2C338&ssl=1). The
path from node 7 includes 7, 3, and 1. The path from 8 includes 8, 6,
3, and 1. Please notice that this is not necessarily a binary search
tree.

For simplicity, this assignment asks you to print the path from bottom to top (the root is printed last).
